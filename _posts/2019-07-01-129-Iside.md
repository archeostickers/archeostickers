*Death is not the end* Ã¨ il titolo di una canzone di Bob Dylan tratta da [Down in the Groove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_in_the_Groove) del 1988 e pubblicata anche da Nick Cave in [Murder Ballads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_Ballads) del 1996.

When you're sad and when you're lonely

And you haven't got a friend

Just remember that death is not the end

And all that you held sacred

Falls down and does not mend

Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end

Just remember that death is not the end

When you're standing on the crossroads

That you cannot comprehend

Just remember that death is not the end

And all your dreams have vanished

And you don't know what's up the bend

Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end

Just remember that death is not the end

When the storm clouds gather round you

And heavy rains descend

Just remember that death is not the end

And there is no-one there to comfort you

With a helping hand to lend

Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end

Just remember that death is not the end

For the tree of life is growing

Where the spirit never dies

And the bright light of salvation

Up in dark and empty skies

When the cities are on fire

With the burning flesh of men

Just remember that death is not the end

And you search in vain to find

Some law-abiding citizen

Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end

Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end

Just remember that death is not the end
